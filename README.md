# A Dungeon crawler java game written with libgdx
The Libgdx library was heavily modified and thus included in the project, since this project is not compatible with newer versions of libgdx. Neither is version 1.9.2 (used in this project) supported by LibGDX any more.
The code is a horrible mess from 2012
